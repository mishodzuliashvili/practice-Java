### We have beautiful implementations in Java.
### Have Fun!
### Added
- This changelog :)
- Added CounterClass that can be used in big programs for counting some objects and it has more oportunity than "only have variable count" in object;
- LinkedList. it has value and has next(LinkedList) variable that gives us chain of LinkedLists. 
- Added a few implementations of recursion

There we also can add some useful methods (maybe later...) :3

### Removed
