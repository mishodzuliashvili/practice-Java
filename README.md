# PracticeJava

## 02/02/2022

### We have beautiful implementations in Java.
### Have Fun!
### Added
- This changelog :)
- Added CounerClass that can be used in big programs for counting some objects and it has more oportunity than "only have variable count" in object;
- LinkedList. it has value and has next(LinkedList) variable that gives us chain of LinkedLists. There we also can add some useful methods (maybe later...).

### Removed

- We haven't delete any file yet.
